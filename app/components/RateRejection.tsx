I want to be transparent about our decision process and share specific reasons why we chose to move forward with another candidate.

We were looking for someone with more experience in content recommendation algorithms, specifically in the streaming media space. Your background in e-commerce recommendations is strong, but we needed someone who could hit the ground running with our specific tech stack.

This doesn't diminish your skills ‚Äì it's simply about finding the right match for our immediate needs. Your technical foundation is solid, and with some streaming industry experience, you'd be a great fit for similar roles.

Your insights about the psychological aspects of video communication were fascinating, and I can tell you've thought deeply about these challenges. While we're moving forward with another candidate for this specific role, I wanted to personally reach out because our conversation left such an impression on me.

Have you considered roles that combine technology with behavioral psychology? I think that intersection might be a perfect fit for your unique perspective.
